# HomeSlice
HomeSlice is a first of its kind Home Equity marketplace designed to provide an outlet for homeowners to seamlessly get cash for their home equity while providing investors with a cost-effective entry point into real estate investing.

In exchange for a “Slice” (% share) of their home equity, eligible homeowners can get up to 30% of their home’s value in cash quickly; no banks, no lengthy waiting period, and no principle and interest payments. 

Gone are the days where hefty down payments and net worth are requirements to diversify into real estate, investors are able to easily buy and sell Slices on our platform in a free market auction style format. 

Our best in class application combined with advanced data techniques allow us to deliver on our offerings quickly and easily. HomeSlice leverages machine learning to synthesize macroeconomic and median sales data to risk adjust properties and provide fair cash offers to homeowners in minutes. 

Welcome to HomeSlice.
